# DeathRow

# 💀 DeathRow

**DeathRow** is a multiplayer survival and deception game set inside a brutal, dystopian facility where only the most productive — or cunning — survive. Players must complete daily tasks, avoid sabotage, and stay out of trouble. At the end of each day, someone is eliminated — either due to poor performance or... darker circumstances.

Sabotage, murder, and manipulation are all on the table — but guards are watching, and suspicion spreads fast.

## 🧠 Core Mechanics

### ✅ Task Completion
- Players are assigned randomized tasks daily.
- Incomplete or poorly done tasks lead to suspicion and elimination.

### 🛠️ Sabotage
- Players can subtly interfere with others’ tasks or steal tools.
- Every sabotage action risks exposure.

### 🔪 Kill & Conceal
- Sharp objects can be found throughout the map.
- Players can eliminate each other — but must clean the scene and avoid witnesses.
- Being caught leads to immediate execution.

### 👮 Surveillance & Guards
- AI-controlled guards or security systems monitor behavior.
- Suspicious players are interrogated or removed.
- Other players can report suspicious activity — real or fake.

### ☠️ Nightly Elimination
- At the end of each in-game day:
  - The lowest-performing player is eliminated automatically.
  - OR, if a murder is suspected, a suspect may be executed.
